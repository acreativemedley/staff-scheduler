# Alternative Platforms for Staff Scheduling App

## The Problem with Google Apps Script
- Multi-user deployment is unreliable
- Google's tightening security policies block external users
- No guarantee of consistent access for staff members
- Time already invested could be wasted if deployment never works

## My Strong Recommendation: Google Sites + Google Forms + Sheets

**For your specific needs (free + reliable), I recommend the Google Sites approach because:**

1. **100% Free forever** - no monthly costs
2. **Uses Google tools you know** - Sites, Forms, Sheets
3. **Guaranteed multi-user access** - Google Sites has no deployment issues
4. **Professional appearance** - modern, mobile-responsive
5. **Reliable platform** - Google Sites is stable and mature
6. **Keep your logic** - adapt your existing code for background processing

**How We'd Migrate:**
1. **Google Sites**: Create main dashboard/navigation
2. **Google Forms**: Convert your modals to forms (staff entry, availability, time-off)
3. **Google Sheets**: Keep your data structure (just different input method)
4. **Apps Script**: Background automation only (no web deployment issues)

**Example Structure:**
```
Main Site (Google Sites)
├── Staff Management (Google Form → Sheet)
├── Set Availability (Google Form → Sheet) 
├── Request Time Off (Google Form → Sheet)
├── View Schedule (Google Sites page showing Sheet data)
└── Admin Dashboard (Google Sites page with embedded sheets)
```
