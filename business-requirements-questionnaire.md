weekly

## Time-Off & Availability

### 12. What types of time-off do you need to handle?

**Answer:**
all time off is the same

### 13. How much advance notice do you require for time-off requests?
*Examples: 2 weeks for vacation, 24 hours for sick, etc.*

**Answer:**
requests can be submitted at any time, but if it is less than 4 weeks before the date, I would like to recieve and email notifying me so I can edit the schedule

### 14. Do you have blackout dates when no one can take time off?
*Examples: holiday shopping season, busy summer months, etc.*

**Answer:**
no

### 15. How do you want to handle the RED/YELLOW availability system?
*RED = absolutely cannot work, YELLOW = prefer not to work but available if needed*

**What makes a day RED vs YELLOW for your staff?**

**Answer:**
I would like to have a basic table with the days of the week where for each employee I can fill in Red - can't work at all, green - can work, yellow - would prefer not to work but can if needed. I also need to be able to indicate availability by time - i.e. Mirannda can work on Tuesdays, but not before 10:30, so if I tried to schedule her at 10, the system would flag it for me.
I also need to record how many hours a week an employee is willing to work, so if I try to schedule above that it will flag it. I want to be able to override it, but be aware that I am doing it.

## Integration Needs

### 16. Do you use Google Calendar currently for business events?
*If yes, what types of events affect staffing needs?*

**Answer:**
Yes, classes and special events mean that I need more staff, or that I need specific people. I do not need the system to recognize what those needs are, but just to show me what is happening each day so that I can consider what/who is needed

### 17. Do you need to integrate with any other systems?
*Examples: payroll system, POS system, employee management system, etc.*

**Answer:**
no

---

## Additional Requirements

### 18. Who will be the primary users of this system?
*Examples: just you (owner/manager), managers and staff, etc.*

**Answer:**
I will be the one setting the schedule, I would like staff to use it to submit their time off requests and view their schedule.

### 19. What's most important to you in this system?
*Examples: saving time, reducing conflicts, fair distribution of hours, etc.*

**Answer:**
saving time, avoiding scheduling someone when they had requested off, making sure I have sufficient coverage during special events

### 20. Are there any specific features from your requirements document that are most critical to implement first?

**Answer:**
creating a base schedule and collecting time off requests

---

## Notes
*Any additional information, special requirements, or clarifications:*

I do not have enough staff at the moment to meet my coverage requirements and their desires for workload, I need the system to flag the needs, but allow me to override it when needed.

Ideally, I would love to be able to set that Bridget works every other Saturday, Lisa works the alternate Saturdays, Marisa gets 1 Saturday per month off, etc. That is a lower priority than getting the base set.
