# Debugging Time-Off Deletion Issues

## The Problem
You're trying to delete a single occurrence from a recurring time-off pattern (44 occurrences), but after deletion:
1. The occurrence still shows up in the Time-Off Manager list
2. The occurrence still shows as a conflict in the Schedule

## Changes Made

I've added comprehensive logging to both `TimeOffManager.jsx` and `ScheduleGenerator.jsx` to help diagnose the issue.

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your app in the browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Clear the console (click the ðŸš« icon)

### Step 2: Navigate to Time-Off Manager
Watch for these console messages:
- `TimeOffManager: Fetching requests...`
- `TimeOffManager: Parent [id] has X instances`
- List of all instance IDs with dates

### Step 3: Try to Delete an Occurrence
1. Find the recurring request
2. Click "Show All 44" to expand all instances
3. Find the date you want to delete
4. Click the "Ã—" button next to that date
5. Confirm the deletion

### Step 4: Watch Console Logs
You should see:
```
Attempting to delete occurrence with ID: [uuid]
Delete result - data: [...]  error: null
Successfully deleted occurrence, refreshing list...
TimeOffManager: Fetching requests...
TimeOffManager: Fetching at timestamp: [number]
TimeOffManager: Total requests fetched: X
TimeOffManager: Parent [id] has Y instances  (should be one less)
Dispatched timeOffUpdated event
ScheduleGenerator: timeOffUpdated event received, refetching time-off requests
ScheduleGenerator: Fetching time-off requests...
ScheduleGenerator: Fetched X approved time-off requests
```

## Things to Check

### Check 1: Is the DELETE successful?
Look for the line: `Delete result - data: [...] error: null`
- If error is NOT null, there's a database permission issue
- If data is empty array, the row might not exist

### Check 2: Is the refresh happening?
Look for: `Successfully deleted occurrence, refreshing list...`
- This should trigger a new fetch
- You should see `TimeOffManager: Fetching at timestamp:`

### Check 3: Is the count decreasing?
Compare the instance count before and after:
- Before: `TimeOffManager: Parent [id] has 44 instances`
- After: `TimeOffManager: Parent [id] has 43 instances`

### Check 4: Is the ScheduleGenerator updating?
Look for: `ScheduleGenerator: timeOffUpdated event received`
- This should trigger the schedule to refresh
- You should see `ScheduleGenerator: Fetched X approved time-off requests`

## Manual Database Check

If the UI isn't updating but the logs show success, check the database directly:

### Using Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click on "Table Editor" in the sidebar
3. Select the `time_off_requests` table
4. Look for the recurring request's instances
5. Filter by `parent_request_id = [your recurring request ID]`
6. Count the rows - should be 43 after deleting one

### Using SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Find your recurring request
SELECT id, employee_id, recurrence_pattern, recurrence_start_date, recurrence_end_date
FROM time_off_requests
WHERE is_recurring = true AND parent_request_id IS NULL
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Count instances for a specific parent (replace with your parent ID)
SELECT COUNT(*) as instance_count
FROM time_off_requests
WHERE parent_request_id = 'your-parent-uuid-here';

-- See all instances with their dates
SELECT id, start_date, end_date, status
FROM time_off_requests
WHERE parent_request_id = 'your-parent-uuid-here'
ORDER BY start_date;
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Browser Cache
**Solution:** Hard refresh the page
- Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

### Issue 2: Multiple Tabs Open
**Solution:** Close all tabs with the app and open a fresh one
- Multiple tabs might have stale data
- Events might not propagate between tabs

### Issue 3: Status Not 'approved'
**Solution:** Check if the instance has status='approved'
```sql
SELECT id, start_date, status
FROM time_off_requests
WHERE parent_request_id = 'your-parent-uuid-here'
AND status != 'approved';
```
- ScheduleGenerator only shows approved requests
- If an instance has a different status, it won't show as a conflict

### Issue 4: Database RLS Policies
**Solution:** Verify you have delete permission
```sql
-- Check your current user role
SELECT current_user, session_user;

-- Test delete permission (won't actually delete)
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM time_off_requests WHERE id = 'test-id';
```

## Next Steps

After running through these debug steps, report back with:
1. What the console logs show
2. Whether the database count decreased
3. Any error messages you see

This will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
