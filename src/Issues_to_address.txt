Issues to address after app is functional
    Date validation in time off request - same as below
    Time validation in time off request - if time is not valid, can we send an email to the employee notifying them and ask them to fix it? Or can I get a notification so I can manually fix it?
    Validate email, so if there is a mismatch between name and email, it gets highlighted
    put invalid requests (email name mismatch) into a different bucket to be handled manually? Or will being logged in address this?
    Not sending email for short notice requests
